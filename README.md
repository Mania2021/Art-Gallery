# Art Gallery
Art Galleries opened in 2007 with a different idea for an art gallery: Art should be fun. Art should be uplifting. Art should be unique. Art shall tell our stories. Above all, the art we collect should make us smile. Our galleries are family-owned operations, something we see as being part of the American fabric. Our galleries represent artists who produce museum-quality artwork, having mastered their unique mediums and styles. Our focus primarily lies with exhibiting works from regional artists living and producing art today and extends to showing some of history’s most acclaimed and famous artists. With rotating exhibition schedules in each location we are always sourcing brand new artwork directly from the artist’s studios. Our attention is constantly given to guiding and educating both new and seasoned collectors, providing in-depth, insightful and market savvy advice. We pride ourselves on facilitating acquisitions of everlasting beauty and spreading joy throughout the world. We ship artwork to every continent and look forward to helping you add beauty to your life.
